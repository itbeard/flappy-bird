The core classes, functions, and methods necessary for the Flappy Bird game are:

1. `Game` class: This is the main class that will control the game loop, handle events, and manage the game state.
2. `Bird` class: This class will represent the bird character. It will have methods for flapping, falling, and checking for collisions.
3. `Pipe` class: This class will represent the vertical obstacles. It will have methods for moving the pipes and checking if the bird has passed through the gap.
4. `Score` class: This class will keep track of the player's score. It will have methods for incrementing the score and displaying it on the screen.
5. `Sound` class: This class will handle the sound effects for flapping, scoring, and game over.
6. `main` function: This is the entry point of the game. It will create an instance of the `Game` class and start the game loop.

Now, let's write the code for each of these components.
